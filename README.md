# Deploy to Tencent CloudBase

This is an orphan branch that will host the _Tencent CloudBase_ related GitHub Actions workflows and config files.

## CI/CD Workflow

Any pushes on `gh-pages` branch (which is the result of the CI/CD workflow for pushes on `gitbook` branch) will trigger a workflow to deploy the static resources served for [GitHub pages](https://uclcssa.github.io/UCL-Freshers-Guide/) to Tencent CloudBase as well.
